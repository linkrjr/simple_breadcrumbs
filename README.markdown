# Breadcrumbs


This plugin is an attempt to implementation a simple to use breadcrumbs renderer.
The code here was initially implemented as a core lib on a project a later turned into a plugin.

The code was initially based on Przemys≈Çaw Szeryf Kowalczyk sample code 
posted on his blog (http://szeryf.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/easy-and-flexible-breadcrumbs-for-rails/) and then moved on and turned into this plugin.

## Install

script/plugin install git://github.com/linkrjr/breadcrumbs

## Usage

### Controllers setup

Controllers are setup by calling the "breadcrumbs" class method

#### Simple sample

Call the "breadcrumbs" method inside your controllers and pass it a block	

    class AnyController < ApplicationController
      breadcrumbs do |breadcrumb|
        breadcrumb.add("Home","/") 
        breadcrumb.add("First","/first")
        breadcrumb.add("Second", :only => [:show, :new, :edit])    
      end
    end

The method "add" above will be available from the block parameter.

Add method parameters:	
	
__text__ => The text to be display in the breadcrumbs.  

__url=''__ => The url to link to, not mandatory so no link will be created.  

__options={}__ => The same list of options that can be passed to a before_filter, [click here](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Filters/ClassMethods.html#M000526) for more details.  

__&block__ => A block can be used to add dynamic parameters to a url, see example below for more details.  

	
#### Dynamic urls	

    breadcrumbs do |breadcrumb|
      breadcrumb.add("Home","/") 
      breadcrumb.add("First","/first")
      breadcrumb.add("Second", :only => [:show, :new, :edit]) do 
        {:method => "second_path", :parameters => ["params[:id]"]}
      end
    end

Parameters can be passed to methods that will create the url string, 
the parameters must be ordered following the sequence of parameters the method expects

Eg.: second_path(param1, param2) => {:method => "second_path", :parameters => ["param1","param2"]}

### Rendering breadcrumbs

There are 3 possible ways to render the breadcrumbs:

- Default Layout
- Passing a partial
- Passing a block
	
#### Default Layout

The plugin will look for a layout called _breadcrumbs.html.erb in the layouts folder.

    <% render_breadcrumbs %>

#### Passing a partial

A partial can be create and passed in just like a normal render.

    <% render_breadcrumbs :partial => "breadcrumbs" %> - *will look for the partial inside the processed view page folder*

or

    <% render_breadcrumbs :partial => "layouts/breadcrumbs" %> - *will look for the partial inside the layouts folder*

The partial filename follows the same rules for creating partials

#### Passing a block

A block containing the html to be rendered can be used

    <% breadcrumbs do %>
	   <% if @breadcrumbs %>
	     <div id="breadcrumbs">
	       <ul>
	         <% @breadcrumbs.each do |txt, path| %>
	           <li><%= link_to(txt, path) %></li>
	         <% end  %>
	       </ul>
	     </div>
	   <% end -%>
    <% end %>	

#### Available variables

A variable called @breadcrumbs will be available in each of the three option above mentioned, 
this variable is an array containing the text and the url for the breadcrumbs
